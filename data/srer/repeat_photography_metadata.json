Mesquite alive, ocotillo, desert spoon far right midground. Lehmann lovegrass common, with Setaria, and cane beardgrass plants scattered; also find threeawns and a few cottontop. The area appears to have been covered with dodder in the recent past (probably 2 years ago because litter is grey in color) because litter includes that type of plant, and the density of grass has decreased and Calliandra is now absent compared to 2007.  This absence is almost unique to this view because to the left and right, as well as up and down slope, there are no such bare-ground conditions.  In addition, six sandbur plants (Cenchrus sp. perennial longevity) were found and dug-up (but not removed) to the immediate left and behind the few in this photo.  First time I have seen that species on the Santa Rita.  Compared to 2000, ocotillo in foreground is dead and on ground; no Calliandra present now; and four Yerba Santa (Baccharis pterinoides) are near the two Mimosa plants in the near center-midground area.

Witness present, camera above. Mesquite alive. Zizyphus distant center next to the old mesquite present in 1915 image, and much of the Zizyphus and old mesquite were burned in 1994 fire. Barrel cacti center is still present from 2016, with dead barrel still visible nearby. Fourwing saltbush next to the Ziziphus. Catclaw present midground left. Chainfruit cholla under closest mesquite in left foreground. Other shrubs are Janusia, burroweed, Lycium; and perennial grasses are Lehmann lovegrass and sideoats grama in open, but under mesquite find Setaria, cottontop, and bush muhly. No evidence of telephone post from older photos. Fire was 1994. Compared to 2016, more grass cover (especially Lehmann lovegrass) and species (added sideoats, cottontop and Sporobolus); larger burroweed and cholla plants, some dead burroweed, and Ziziphus is not doing well.

Compared to 1902, there is a significant increase in the mesquite and woody plant cover on the slopes above and on both sides of the wash; the small water basin is no longer obvious in the wash; tree density in the wash appears greater, and the increase/arrival of blue palo verde seems to contribute to the increase in tree cover; and tree cover and density has greatly increased on the tops of the slopes, and this is most clearly visible as a change from only a few trees on the horizontal lands in 1902 compared to the solid dark line of trees on that horizon line above the slopes.\u00a0 M.
